# SentimentAnalysis
This is a sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews
For a very long time, making a machine understand the natural language
and process it to perform a creative task has been a problem of high priority to human.
Classifying whether a product being sold is worth buying makes it easier for the buyer to
make his decision. This also helps the seller to analyse his sales. In this paper, we have
done a comparative analysis of dierent machine learning algorithms and studied how well
each algorithm works in classifying human sentiments from natural language in text based
product reviews.
